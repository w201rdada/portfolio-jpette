I’m also a text reference, which is a line of text you can reuse in several places. Use me to write a one paragraph abstract and place it in index.Rmd as well as under the title of 01.Rmd. Once defined, you can reuse me simply by writing (ref:abs1) where you want this text to go. Keywords music, discovery, passive, listener, Pandora, Spotify 1.1 The Problems with Music Algorithms Music recommendation algorithms have been popular for the better part of twenty years. Pandora blazed the trail in the early 2000s and Spotify and others are now trying to assume control of that realm. Despite increasingly complex algorithms trying to identify matches between music and consumers, though, the algorithms are based on identifying musical links between songs, ignoring non-musical factors (brianwhitman 2012). Published research shows that people become set in their musical tastes as time passes and that most people are set in their musical ways by their early 30’s (ajaymkalia 2015). This makes logical sense, as competing life priorities take precedence over time. People seem to care less as time goes on and many forget how to find new music, much in the way that some find it difficult to make new friends after a certain age. The anecdotal interest is there, though: whenever I hear someone say, “I don’t know any new music anymore,” I ask questions to learn why. I will occasionally hear, “I know what I like,” but the much more common response is, “I would love to find new music, but I don’t know where to start.” There is vast, untapped potential in the sizable passive consumer market. Artists, music apps, and record labels are not capitalizing on this income, and that represents an opportunity. My approach will identify artist links that go beyond musical algorithms and deliver material reliably to the passive end user. 1.2 Music Discovery: Unconventional Resources How can we bridge this gap? The existing algorithms are powerful from a strictly musical standpoint, but there are some basic variables that are evidently not considered. If an algorithm has a base of thirty independent rock songs with female vocals, but three songs later, spits out AC/DC, something is wrong with the algorithm. How should we define “new” music? Our goal is to recommend artists and songs to consumers that existing algorithms would not. This means that the material is not necessarily new, but it should be new to them. This algorithm will filter for independent artists and labels to increase the likelihood of making novel recommendations. I plan to attack this issue from multiple angles: 1. Social Media Mentions: Non-musical links between artists will be most evident on social media; we can find them by pulling data from Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and more music-focused apps like Songkick. Artists do not need to be active on social media for this to work: they only need users to mention them. Two bands that are commonly mentioned by a single user have a clear link that goes beyond the sound of the songs. 2. Bandcamp Collections: Another key source of data will be fan pages on Bandcamp. Whenever a consumer purchases music from an artist, it becomes part of a public fan page collection. Mining those collections for common links between artists will produce another key source for our recommendations. 3. Discogs Collections: Discogs is the world’s preeminent assemblage of music discographies and represents what should be the second largest music marketplace after eBay (sales figures are not public). Users are able to document their music collections through tools on the site; Discogs contains thousands of public collection lists that would provide an additional important resource. 4. eBay: Finally, I will monitor eBay stores to see where there are common links between artists in sellers’ inventories. This is an imperfect measure, as sellers do not restrict themselves to individual genres. However, a large enough sample size will correct for that effect and should still produce useful data. I will cross-reference the correlations found in the various data sources, and test the algorithm’s outputs against suggestions made by the established industry leaders. If I find a statistically significant quantity of novel results, I can implement the delivery solution: short, tailored playlists, emailed to users on a weekly basis. 1.3 Delivering to the Passive Listener If a service were to deliver hour-long playlists based on your tastes via email on a weekly basis, would they intrigue you? Would you listen to them? They would take the time of a podcast and be just as portable. The ability to capitalize on the entertainment dollar of the passive music listener will hinge upon eliminating any activity that would require effort. If I can introduce them to new music without making them work for it, I can dramatically improve the consumer experience, and can then convert that experience into profits. Naturally, the algorithm does not represent a perfect solution. No single platform will produce perfect results, and there will be a significant amount of noise in the data. However, with large enough sample sizes, I can correct for this sufficiently. The major limitation of this model is that it relies on a user base that is online and willing to use the tools at their disposal to listen to music. In its current form, it will not reach users who rely exclusively on listening to physical formats. Once the first model is established, I will look for ways to reach these users. Every few years, innovation drives new financial successes in the music industry. There are major players in the music industry, but none of them have fully capitalized on the potential of the passive listener. My model can speak to the passive fan and could be the next big music innovation. Bibliography "],

And a text reference! An abstract is all three acts of your story in a tight little package. You may or may not want to give the ending away, but if you think there’s a chance an audience will read this and nothing else, you’d better convey your argument here in miniature. People are busy after all, and there’s just so much good tv on the Internet these days. Keywords vinyl, records, music, collectible, value forecasting, valuation, projection, investment 2.1 The Vinyl Market People declared the death of the vinyl record music format long ago, as CDs took over and were then summarily supplanted by digital formats. Throughout this time, there has been a consistent base of record collectors. The format has taken off anew to an unexpected degree, and many more collectors have entered the market. 2017 saw 14.32 million new records sold in the U.S., the largest volume of sold since Nielsen began tracking vinyl sales in 1991(U.S. Vinyl Album Sales Hit Nielsen Music-Era Record High in 2017 2018). This behavior transcends nostalgia; MusicWatch completed a survey in 2016 that showed that 34% of new vinyl buyers (and 27% of used vinyl buyers) were in the 13-24 age range(A Mid-Year Look at Vinyl \\Textbar MusicWatch Inc. 2018). The used record market is thriving as well. In the past 60 days, eBay shows a global sales total of nearly 1.2 million records. In its 2017 annual report, Discogs declared nearly 8 million new and used sales through its marketplace(Music Sales &amp; Collection Data \\Textbar State of Discogs 2017 \\Textbar Discogs Blog 2018). As with any collectible, the values of rare records fluctuate over time. Anecdotally, there is a predictable cycle to changes in value. Can publicly available data demonstrate that cycle and determine why? With a detailed model demonstrating the effects, I will build an application for buyers and sellers that helps them achieve optimal value in their activities. 2.2 Buyer Behavior in a World of Sales Data Ultimately, this is a fundamental question about human behavior. Collectible value is a social construct which generally follows economic demand principles. At the heart of this exploration is one main question: why do people change their ideas of what a collectible is worth, and can we predict it? In order to show conclusive results, this study would need to examine large samples of data over many years. However, there is enough public data available to provide a good approximation of the collectible life cycle. I plan to examine data from two main sources: eBay sales records, which are complete and available by API, but are only available publicly for 60 days. Discogs marketplace sales records, which are publicly available through an API. The study will examine the price history for a sample of test items in an attempt to identify patterns in fluctuations of value. With a large enough sample size, trends should be evident. There are some limitations to each data source: eBay records do not show historical sales beyond 60 days and Discogs records only display the last 10-20 sales of an item. If I am able to partner directly with these companies through an agreement, I may have access to a larger sample of data. Discogs and eBay represent the largest consolidated marketplaces for used music, but they do not constitute the full market. Brick-and-mortar stores are ubiquitous, and their transaction data will never be available; their sales would likely show greater price disparities due to their smaller quantities of consumers, some of whom have more limited market information. However, this should not be a major detractor; Discogs and eBay should be more accurate models of value because they allow for global competition. While not every consumer uses them, serious collectors have no choice but to monitor them. The data also do not account for external events that have effects on the market: when the global economy crashed in 2008, collectible values plummeted, presumably as people refocused on life’s necessities. This price drop had a ripple effect on prices for years afterward. Despite these drawbacks, currently available data will provide useful insights into overall trends. Over time, I will expand the sample size and increase the quality of the model, pairing the data with forecasting software. At that stage, I can also account for external market events and seasonal trends. 2.3 Enabling Collectors and Vendors If this model demonstrates meaningful results, it will be an extremely valuable resource for collectors or investors who are trying to determine when to buy or how long to hold items before selling. Of course, if all buyers and sellers had this information, it would shift values toward market efficiency, which, in the end, would change the model to one of basic demand. While a very different industry, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) demonstrates this effect frequently in supporting international farmers; by providing farmers in developing countries with market information, USAID has been able to transform agricultural markets, ensuring that these farmers can achieve proper market prices(“ADVANCE II Case Study” 2018). When sufficiently complete, this collectible valuation model can be expanded to explore additional questions about the life cycle of collectibles, such as, “why do certain collectibles lose all value over a long period of time or become prohibitively expensive?” This is not a simple question of scarcity or popularity of the subject, and will require deeper examination.
