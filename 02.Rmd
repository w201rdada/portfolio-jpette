## The Vinyl Market

I have been buying and selling rare vinyl records since 1991. People declared the death of the vinyl format long ago, as CDs took over and were then summarily supplanted by digital formats. Throughout this time, there has been a consistent base of record collectors. The format took off anew to an unexpected degree, and many more collectors have entered the market. As with any collectible, the values of rare records fluctuate over time. Anecdotally, there is a predictable cycle to changes in value. I plan to use available data to demonstrate that cycle and determine why. With a detailed model demonstrating the effects, I will build an application for buyers and sellers that helps them achieve optimal value in their activities.

## Buyer Behavior in a World of Sales Data
Ultimately, this is a fundamental question about human behavior. Collectible value is a social construct which generally follows economic demand principles. At the heart of this exploration is one main question: why do people change their ideas of what a collectible is worth, and can we predict it?

In order for this study to show conclusive results, I would need to examine large samples of data over many years. However, there is enough public data available to provide a good approximation of the collectible life cycle. 
I plan to pull data from three sources:

1. eBay sales records, which are complete, but are only available publicly for short periods of time.
2. Discogs sales records, which can be accessed by a publicly available API. 
3. Popsike, a database of eBay sales of records that extends back for several years, but is partially incomplete.

I will examine the price history for a sample of test items in an attempt to identify patterns in fluctuations of value. With a large enough sample size, trends should be evident.

There are some limitations to each data source: eBay records do not show historical sales beyond 60 days, Discogs records only display the last 10-20 sales of an item, and Popsike records do not catalogue every transaction - they omit everything below a certain dollar threshold. The data also do not account for external events that have effects on the market: when the global economy crashed in 2008, collectible values plummeted, presumably as people refocused on lifeâ€™s necessities. This price drop had a ripple effect on prices for years afterward. 

Despite these drawbacks, currently available data will provide useful insights into overall trends. Over time, I will expand the sample size and increase the quality of the model. At that time, I can also account for external market events and seasonal trends.

## Enabling Collectors and Vendors

If this model demonstrates meaningful results, it will be an extremely valuable resource for collectors or investors who are trying to determine when to buy or how long to hold items before selling. Of course, too much knowledge can be a bad thing. If all buyers and sellers had this information, it would artificially skew values, which, in the end, would change the model. 

Once I complete the model to my satisfaction, I will expand it to explore additional questions about the life cycle of collectibles, such as: what are the determining factors behind whether a collectible loses all value over a long period of time or becomes prohibitively expensive? This is not a simple question or scarcity or popularity of the subject and will require deeper examination.
