## A beginning.

I have been buying and selling rare vinyl records since 1991. People declared the death of vinyl long ago, as CDs took over and were then summarily supplanted by digital formats. Throughout this time, there has been a consistent base of record collectors. The format has unexpectedly taken off anew, and many more collectors have entered the market. As with any collectible, the values of rare records fluctuate over time. Anecdotally, there is a predictable cycle to changes in value. I would like to use available data to demonstrate that cycle and determine why.

## A middle.

I plan to pull data from three sources:
1. eBay sales records, which are publicly available.
2. Discogs sales records, which can be accessed by API. 
3. Popsike, a database of eBay sales of records that extends back several years.

I will examine the price history for a number of test items in an attempt to identify the pattern. With a large enough sample size, any trends should be evident.

## An end.

There are some limitations to each data source: eBay records do not extend back very far, Discogs records only display the last 10-20 sales of an item, and Popsike records do not catalogue every transaction - they omit everything below a certain dollar threshold.

Despite these drawbacks, capturing current data over time and an expanding sample size will increase the quality of the model. If it demonstrates meaningful results, it will be an extremely valuable resource for collectors or investors who are trying to determine when to buy or how long to hold items.
